  description: "Rehangki, also known as the Morung, is basically a traditional male dormitory which also served as a training centre and social hub for young men. Every clan of a particular Zeliang village has their own clan's Rehangki. The word 'Rehang' means male youth and 'Ki' means house. So, the word Rehangki literally means a house for the male of a village.",

      content: "The roofing of a typical, traditional Rehangki of the Zeliang/Naga was made of thatch and the frames made of wood and bamboo which covers the two sides of the wall from the top to the bottom and do not have vertical side walls. The entrance is usually a one-door entrance and the walls and the door made of selectively-picked century's old wood. Some southern Zeliang do make two doors too though. The spears of the youths are hung up at the entrance wall of the Rehangki which are meant to be readily available during emergencies.",

      content: "The front room of the Rehangki features a fireplace with benches around it where men socialized, and the main bed where they rested for the night. The fireplace served as the gathering point for storytelling, cultural education, and community bonding. The warm glow of the fire created an atmosphere conducive to learning and preserving tribal traditions for future generations. The bed of the Rehangki is usually made of a single piece of wood (15 – 20 feet long and 5-6 feet wide) of a single tree particularly that of a BONSUM TREE (NGA BANG) which was usually centuries old. It was considered taboo for girls to climb, sit or sleep on the bed. It was also considered taboo for the girls to sit or even cross over the bench placed on the side facing the wall of the next room known as HEDA LE BAM. The next room at the back would be the kitchen and bedroom occupied by the care-taker's family.",

      content: "Whenever wild animals were hunted down, the hunter donates the head of the animal to the Rehangki. The heads of only four-footed-hoofed animals were accepted and also it had to be a hunted one (either shot or speared) and not trapped ones or carcasses. Only those boys who have aged pass the breast-feeding stage or have passed a particular ritual of maturity known as NLAU were allowed to partake in this feast of eating the cooked parts of the animal head TEEI PEU TEI. Women were also not allowed to eat the TEEI PEU TEI. The female caretaker of the Rehangki also was not allowed to eat the TEEIPEU TEI but she would be given innards of the hunted animals by the hunter to cook for herself. Anyone who partakes in the feast does not say that they are too full to eat anymore, but they'd rather say \"Tyei dui da\" which means \"Not enough\". The skulls of the head of the animals were carefully crafted out without breaking them and they were/are displayed as trophies in the Rehangki. The skull of the animal is usually tight with a leafy plant known as Tamram.",

They were usually the first to light the fire place of the Rehangki first thing in the morning. However, between the two of them, the Hangsiupui played a bigger role as she was placed with greater responsibilities of looking after the Rehangki and the men folk. She had to fetch water and provide extra firewood if needed, provide drinks to those men who comes to the Rehangki without their drinks, cooks broth or rice for the men folk prior to their expedition of catching mithun for FEAST OF MERIT (HEKUI TSAHA) and also during funerals of prominent men of the village.",

      content: "In the olden days, the Rehangki or Morung of the Zeliang/Naga was made of simple natural materials like wood, bamboo and cane and decorated with wood carvings and skulls and was religiously and efficiently managed and maintained. However, with the widespread adoption of modern education and westernization the concept of a traditional morung has declined. Even some morungs are now built with modern building materials which have led to the loss of its originality. But, the concept of the morung is still valued for its deep cultural and social significance and efforts are being made to preserve its legacy."
